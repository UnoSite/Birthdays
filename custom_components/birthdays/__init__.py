"""Birthdays integration for Home Assistant.

This integration allows users to track birthdays using sensors and a calendar.
Each configured birthday instance creates:
- A sensor showing the person's name.
- A binary sensor indicating if today is their birthday.
- A sensor counting days until the next birthday.
- A sensor showing the birth date.
- A sensor showing the person's age.
- A calendar with all birthdays.

Configuration is handled via the UI (Config Flow).
